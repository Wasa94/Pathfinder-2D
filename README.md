# Pathfinder 2D
Unity application whose goal is to calculate the shortest path from the start position to the end position while adding random non-passable blocks to the map.

In game menu lets you select size of map (width and height), start and end positions, different algorithms and manual/automatic level start.  
Available algorithms are DFS (path found is not always shortest), BFS, Dijkstra and A*.

**In game commands:**
* "Q" - Quit game  
* "S" - Stop game (leveling)  
* Little yellow button - Hide/Show UI  
* "Calculate" button (visible only if it is manual level start selected) - Calculate next level  
* "Level X" button - Show algorithms details of that level (if game is stoped/finished map will be set for that level)  
* Little blue button of algorithm - Start runner for that alghoritm on selected level
